<p style="text-align: justify">
	I am a <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/">Master of Computational Data Science</a> student in the <a href="http://www.scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, with emphasis on machine learning, its implementation on large datasets, and its deployment to distributed systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	My current projects are sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction and search algorithms for decoding, advised by <a href="http://www.phontron.com/">Prof. Graham Neubig</a>. In particular, I am developing the adaptive beam search methods and the actor-critic reinforcement learning models to control the search process. The tasks include automatic transcription (speech recognition), machine translation, and other natural language processing applications.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I am familiar with MapReduce frameworks including Apache Hadoop and Spark, Hadoop Distributed File System, optimizing Spark RDD operations, efficient data engineering, and implementation of machine learning algorithms such as belief propagation or linear regression in the MapReduce framework. I also have experiences working on distributed computing platforms and their orchestration, such as debugging, load balancing, and provisioning of AWS EC2 instances with Spark Monitor UI, AWS ELB, and CloudWatch.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Before joining CMU, I conducted research in the <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/mlgroup/">Machine Learning Group</a> in <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/">National Taiwan Univeristy</a>, led by <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/">Prof. Chih-Jen Lin</a>. My research was on the second-order optimization methods for deep neural networks, and the development of the solver for classifiers based on the neural nets. I designed and implemented the optimization algorithm that largely reduces the memory usage by exploiting the data structure of the model, so that the method could be applied to large-scale datasets. The result was published on Neural Computation (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00130">arXiv:1802.00130</a>).
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	During my work at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, I analyzed the astrophysical data coming from the <a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA">European Space Agency</a>, and built a model to categorize the behavior of the data. The result was published on Physical Review D (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05980">arXiv:1505.05980</a>). I also developed a numerical code for solving the non-linear system in astrophysics, and participated in improving the compatibility of the open-source code, <a href="http://camb.info/">CAMB</a>, with non-parametrized data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	I also worked on image generation using probabilistic graphical models, generative adversarial networks for transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning on knowledge graph. I am familiar with deep learning computational graph frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have worked on various types of datasets including documents (e.g. RCV1, DBpedia, IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset), graphs (e.g. Freebase), and images (e.g. MNIST, UCI Statlog).
