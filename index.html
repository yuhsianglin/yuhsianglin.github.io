<p style="text-align: justify">
	I am a <a href="https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/">Master of Computational Data Science</a> student in the <a href="http://www.scs.cmu.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/index.shtml">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, with emphasis on machine learning, its implementation on large datasets, and its deployment to distributed systems.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	Currently I am interning at <a href="https://a9.com/">A9</a> as a Software Development Intern in Amazon Search, developing the two-phase ranking model for Amazon Business. Online and offline evaluation shows that the new model improves the ranking quality of product search and reduces the tail latency. I am also developing the feature for the machine learning infrastructure that supports customer engagement weighting in both model training and evaluation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
	At CMU, my recent work is on sequence-to-sequence models in natural language processing. I am developing the speech-to-phoneme transcription system for low-resource languages, advised by <a href="http://www.phontron.com/">Prof. Graham Neubig</a>. I also worked on the search algorithms for structured prediction. In particular, I formulated the reinforcement learning (RL) problem for adaptive beam search in sequence-to-sequence models to control the search space, and implemented the RL and adaptive beam search environment, with the RL agent trained by the actor-critic method.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	I am familiar with MapReduce frameworks including Apache Hadoop and Spark, Hadoop Distributed File System, optimizing Spark RDD operations, efficient data engineering, and implementation of machine learning algorithms such as belief propagation or linear regression in the MapReduce framework. I also have experiences working on distributed computing platforms and their orchestration, such as debugging, load balancing, and provisioning of AWS EC2 instances with Spark Monitor UI, AWS ELB, and CloudWatch.
</p><br>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Before joining CMU, I conducted research in the <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/mlgroup/">Machine Learning Group</a> in <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.tw/">National Taiwan Univeristy</a>, led by <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/">Prof. Chih-Jen Lin</a>. My research was on the second-order optimization methods for deep neural networks, and the development of the solver for classifiers based on the neural nets. I designed and implemented the optimization algorithm that largely reduces the memory usage by exploiting the data structure of the model, so that the method could be applied to large-scale datasets. The result was published on <a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/neco_a_01088">Neural Computation</a>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	During my work at <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a>, advised by <a href="https://lecospa.ntu.edu.tw/person/pisin-chen/">Prof. Pisin Chen</a>, I analyzed the astrophysical data coming from the <a href="http://www.esa.int/ESA">European Space Agency</a>, and built a model to categorize the behavior of the data. The result was published on <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.93.023503">Physical Review D</a>. I also developed a numerical code for solving the non-linear system in astrophysics, and participated in improving the compatibility of the open-source code, <a href="http://camb.info/">CAMB</a>, with non-parametrized data.

<p style="text-align: justify">
	I also worked on image generation using probabilistic graphical models, generative adversarial networks for transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning on knowledge graph. I am familiar with deep learning computational graph frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have worked on various types of datasets including documents (e.g. RCV1, DBpedia, IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset), graphs (e.g. Freebase), and images (e.g. MNIST, UCI Statlog).
